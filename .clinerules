## Key Learnings & Patterns

_(This section will be populated as development progresses)_

- **Example Pattern:** (e.g., Always use named exports for Server Actions to improve clarity.)
- **User Preference:** (e.g., Prefer Shadcn `Sheet` component for cart display over a modal.)
- **Technical Decision:** (e.g., Decided against using a specific library due to X reason.)
- **Workflow Note:** (e.g., Remember to run `npm run db:generate` after schema changes.)

## Tool Usage Preferences

_(Document preferred ways to use tools like `replace_in_file` vs `write_to_file` for specific scenarios in this project)_

## Important Reminders

- Refer to `memory-bank/` files for core project context.

- Ensure Jest/Cypress tests accompany new features/actions.
- Validate inputs and check authorization rigorously in Server Actions.
