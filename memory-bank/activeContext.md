# Active Context: Multi-Vendor Marketplace

## Current Work Focus

The project is in its initial setup phase. We're focusing on establishing the foundational architecture and preparing for development of the core features.

### Primary Focus Areas
1. Project initialization and structure setup
2. Database schema design and configuration
3. Authentication system implementation
4. Basic UI components and layouts

## Recent Changes

None yet. The project is just being initialized with the creation of the memory bank.

## Next Steps

Following the phased approach outlined in the project brief, we will:

### Immediate (Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Foundation)

1. **Initialize Next.js Project**
   - Set up Next.js 15 with App Router
   - Configure TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI
   - Set up TypeScript
   - Initialize ESLint and Prettier

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Configure PostgreSQL connection
   - Set up Drizzle ORM
   - Create initial database schema for users and authentication
   - Implement database migration system

3. **Authentication System**
   - Implement NextAuth.js v5 with email/password provider
   - Create login and registration forms
   - Set up middleware for route protection
   - Implement role and status-based access control

4. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Configure Resend email service
   - Implement password reset token generation and validation
   - Create password reset forms and workflows

5. **Basic Static Pages**
   - Create layout components
   - Implement basic navigation
   - Add placeholder pages for terms, privacy policy, about

### Upcoming (Phase 2: Product Management)

1. Define complete database schema
2. Implement file upload system
3. Create vendor dashboard for product management
4. Build product listing and detail pages

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Server Actions vs. API Routes**: Using Server Actions as the primary method for data mutations, with API Routes only for external integrations (e.g., webhooks)
- **Component Organization**: Deciding on the organization of UI components, form components, and layout components
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Implementing consistent error handling across all Server Actions with proper user feedback

### Technical Considerations
- **File Storage**: Using local file system storage with awareness of scalability limitations
- **Database Schema**: Designing efficient schema relationships for products, variants, orders, and users
- **Authentication Strategy**: Implementing proper role and status-based authorization checks
- **Form Validation**: Using Zod for server-side validation of all inputs

### UX Considerations
- **Dashboard Layout**: Creating intuitive dashboards for each user role
- **Product Management Flow**: Designing efficient product creation and management workflows for vendors
- **Checkout Experience**: Planning for seamless checkout experience with proper validation and error handling
